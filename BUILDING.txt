Stuff the instructions assume you have the following installed and on your path:
    * NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
    * AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/)
    * 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/)

Steps to build the installer:
    1) Create a folder to put all the necessary bits in.
    2) Download Meld (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/meld/1.8/meld-1.8.1.tar.xz).
    3) Extract Meld into a folder named 'meld' in your new folder.
    4) Download Portable Python (http://www.portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython2.7.5.1).
    5) Run Portable Python installer to put Python and PyGTK (and nothing else) into a folder called 'python' in your new folder.  You'll need to move the contents up, since the installer always creates a subdirectory called 'Portable Python 2.7.5.1'.
    6) Run "Ahk2exe.exe /in meld.ahk /icon meld.ico".
    7) Put the generated 'meld.exe' file into the 'meld' folder.
    8) Put 'meld.ico' file into the 'meld' folder.
    9) Put 'installer.nsi' and 'LICENSES.rtf' into your new folder.
   10) If you are changing the version of Meld, remember to change the version in 'installer.nsi', and if this is a binary for Git master, remember to change the verison in 'meldapp.py' to match the commit SHA-1 from the Git log.
   11) Run "makensis installer.nsi".

Steps to build the portable zip archive:
    1) Follow steps 1-8 of the installer instructions.
    2) Run "7z.exe a -mx9 test.zip meld python".

Note for either, if you have started Meld in your newly created folder, to delete the .pyc files in the folder 'meld\meld' before zipping/compiling, otherwise they will be included (and some of these files include the path of your temporay directory in them).  If you have Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed, you can just do find meld/meld -iname "*.pyc" -exec rm '{}' ';'
