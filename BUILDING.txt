Stuff the instructions assume you have:
    * NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
    * AutoHotkey (http://www.autohotkey.com/)

Steps to build the installer:
    1) Create a folder to put all the necessary bits in.
    2) Download Meld (http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/meld/1.7/meld-1.7.2.tar.xz).
    3) Extract Meld into a folder named 'meld' in your new folder.
    4) Download Portable Python (http://www.portablepython.com/wiki/PortablePython2.7.3.2).
    5) Run Portable Python installer to put Python and PyGTK (and nothing else) into a folder called 'python' in your new folder.
    6) Compile 'meld.ahk' with AutoHotkey.  Note that to set the icon on the generated .exe, you will need to comile through the GUI and not the Windows Explorer right click.
    7) Put the generated 'meld.exe' file into the 'meld' folder.
    8) Put 'meld.ico' file into the 'meld' folder.
    9) Put 'installer.nsi' and 'LICENSES.rtf' into your new folder.
   10) If you are changing the version of Meld, remember to change the version in 'installer.nsi'.
   11) Compile 'installer.nsi' with NSIS.

Steps to build the portable zip archive:
    1) Follow steps 1-6 of the installer instructions
    2) Use 7-Zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) or similar program to create the zip archive of the two folders.

Note for either, if you have started Meld in your newly created folder, to delete the .pyc files in the folder 'meld\meld' before zipping/compiling, otherwise they will be included (and some of these files include the path of your temporay directory in them).  If you have Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed, you can just do find meld/meld -iname "*.pyc" -exec rm '{}' ';'
